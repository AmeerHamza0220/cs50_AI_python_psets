<h2 id="background"><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/2/heredity/#background">Background</a></h2>

<p>Mutated versions of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1285178/">GJB2 gene</a> are one of the leading causes of hearing impairment in newborns. Each person carries two versions of the gene, so each person has the potential to possess either 0, 1, or 2 copies of the hearing impairment version GJB2. Unless a person undergoes genetic testing, though, it’s not so easy to know how many copies of mutated GJB2 a person has. This is some “hidden state”: information that has an effect that we can observe (hearing impairment), but that we don’t necessarily directly know. After all, some people might have 1 or 2 copies of mutated GJB2 but not exhibit hearing impairment, while others might have no copies of mutated GJB2 yet still exhibit hearing impairment.</p>

<p>Every child inherits one copy of the GJB2 gene from each of their parents. If a parent has two copies of the mutated gene, then they will pass the mutated gene on to the child; if a parent has no copies of the mutated gene, then they will not pass the mutated gene on to the child; and if a parent has one copy of the mutated gene, then the gene is passed on to the child with probability 0.5. After a gene is passed on, though, it has some probability of undergoing additional mutation: changing from a version of the gene that causes hearing impairment to a version that doesn’t, or vice versa.</p>

<p>We can attempt to model all of these relationships by forming a Bayesian Network of all the relevant variables, as in the one below, which considers a family of two parents and a single child.</p>

<p><img src="./Heredity - CSCI E-80_files/gene_network.png" alt="Bayesian Network for genetic traits"></p>

<p>Each person in the family has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gene</code> random variable representing how many copies of a particular gene (e.g., the hearing impairment version of GJB2) a person has: a value that is 0, 1, or 2. Each person in the family also has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trait</code> random variable, which is <code class="highlighter-rouge">yes</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">no</code> depending on whether that person expresses a trait (e.g., hearing impairment) based on that gene. There’s an arrow from each person’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gene</code> variable to their <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trait</code> variable to encode the idea that a person’s genes affect the probability that they have a particular trait. Meanwhile, there’s also an arrow from both the mother and father’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gene</code> random variable to their child’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gene</code> random variable: the child’s genes are dependent on the genes of their parents.</p>

<p>Your task in this project is to use this model to make inferences about a population. Given information about people, who their parents are, and whether they have a particular observable trait (e.g. hearing loss) caused by a given gene, your AI will infer the probability distribution for each person’s genes, as well as the probability distribution for whether any person will exhibit the trait in question.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started"><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/2/heredity/#getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>

  <li data-marker="*"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-circle"></i></span>Download the distribution code from <a href="https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/spring/projects/2/heredity.zip">https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/spring/projects/2/heredity.zip</a> and unzip it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="understanding"><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/2/heredity/#understanding">Understanding</a></h2>

<p>Take a look at one of the sample data sets in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">data</code> directory by opening up <code class="highlighter-rouge">data/family0.csv</code> (you can open it up in a text editor, or in a spreadsheet application like Google Sheets, Excel, or Apple Numbers). Notice that the first row defines the columns for this CSV file: <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">mother</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">father</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">trait</code>. The next row indicates that Harry has Lily as a mother, James as a father, and the empty cell for <code class="highlighter-rouge">trait</code> means we don’t know whether Harry has the trait or not. James, meanwhile, has no parents listed in the our data set (as indicated by the empty cells for <code class="highlighter-rouge">mother</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">father</code>), and does exhibit the trait (as indicated by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">trait</code> cell). Lily, on the other hand, also has no parents listed in the data set, but does not exhibit the trait (as indicated by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">trait</code> cell).</p>

<p>Open up <code class="highlighter-rouge">heredity.py</code> and take a look first at the definition of <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS</code> is a dictionary containing a number of constants representing probabilities of various different events. All of these events have to do with how many copies of a particular gene a person has (hereafter referred to as simply “the gene”), and whether a person exhibits a particular trait (hereafter referred to as “the trait”) based on that gene. The data here is loosely based on the probabilities for the hearing impairment version of the GJB2 gene and the hearing impairment trait, but by changing these values, you could use your AI to draw inferences about other genes and traits as well!</p>

<p>First, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS["gene"]</code> represents the unconditional probability distribution over the gene (i.e., the probability if we know nothing about that person’s parents). Based on the data in the distribution code, it would seem that in the population, there’s a 1% chance of having 2 copies of the gene, a 3% chance of having 1 copy of the gene, and a 96% chance of having 0 copies of the gene.</p>

<p>Next, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS["trait"]</code> represents the conditional probability that a person exhibits a trait (like hearing impairment). This is actually three different probability distributions: one for each possible value for <code class="highlighter-rouge">gene</code>. So <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS["trait"][2]</code> is the probability distribution that a person has the trait given that they have two versions of the gene: in this case, they have a 65% chance of exhibiting the trait, and a 35% chance of not exhibiting the trait. Meanwhile, if a person has 0 copies of the gene, they have a 1% chance of exhibiting the trait, and a 99% chance of not exhibiting the trait.</p>

<p>Finally, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS["mutation"]</code> is the probability that a gene mutates from being the gene in question to not being that gene, and vice versa. If a mother has two versions of the gene, for example, and therefore passes one on to her child, there’s a 1% chance it mutates into not being the target gene anymore. Conversely, if a mother has no versions of the gene, and therefore does not pass it onto her child, there’s a 1% chance it mutates into being the target gene. It’s therefore possible that even if neither parent has any copies of the gene in question, their child might have 1 or even 2 copies of the gene.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the probabilities you calculate will be based on these values in <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS</code>.</p>

<p>Now, take a look at the <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> function. The function first loads data from a file into a dictionary <code class="highlighter-rouge">people</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">people</code> maps each person’s name to another dictionary containing information about them: including their name, their mother (if one is listed in the data set), their father (if one is listed in the data set), and whether they are observed to have the trait in question (<code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code> if they do, <code class="highlighter-rouge">False</code> if they don’t, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">None</code> if we don’t know).</p>

<p>Next, <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> defines a dictionary of <code class="highlighter-rouge">probabilities</code>, with all probabilities initially set to 0. This is ultimately what your project will compute: for each person, your AI will calculate the probability distribution over how many of copies of the gene they have, as well as whether they have the trait or not. <code class="highlighter-rouge">probabilities["Harry"]["gene"][1]</code>, for example, will be the probability that Harry has 1 copy of the gene, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">probabilities["Lily"]["trait"][False]</code> will be the probability that Lily does not exhibit the trait.</p>

<p>If unfamiliar, this <code class="highlighter-rouge">probabilities</code> dictionary is created using a Python <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0274/">dictionary comprehension</a>, which in this case creates one key/value pair for each <code class="highlighter-rouge">person</code> in our dictionary of <code class="highlighter-rouge">people</code>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we’re looking to calculate these probabilities based on some evidence: given that we know certain people do or do not exhibit the trait, we’d like to determine these probabilities. Recall from lecture that we can calculate a conditional probability by summing up all of the joint probabilities that satisfy the evidence, and then normalize those probabilities so that they each sum to 1. Your task in this project is to implement three functions to do just that: <code class="highlighter-rouge">joint_probability</code> to compute a joint probability, <code class="highlighter-rouge">update</code> to add the newly computed joint probability to the existing probability distribution, and then <code class="highlighter-rouge">normalize</code> to ensure all probability distributions sum to 1 at the end.</p>

<h3 id="example-joint-probability"><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2020/spring/projects/2/heredity/#example-joint-probability">Example Joint Probability</a></h3>

<p>To help you think about how to calculate joint probabilities, we’ve included below an example.</p>

<p>Consider the following value for <code class="highlighter-rouge">people</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  'Harry': {'name': 'Harry', 'mother': 'Lily', 'father': 'James', 'trait': None},
  'James': {'name': 'James', 'mother': None, 'father': None, 'trait': True},
  'Lily': {'name': 'Lily', 'mother': None, 'father': None, 'trait': False}
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will here show the calculation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">joint_probability(people, {"Harry"}, {"James"}, {"James"})</code>. Based on the arguments, <code class="highlighter-rouge">one_gene</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">{"Harry"}</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">two_genes</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">{"James"}</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">has_trait</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">{"James"}</code>. This therefore represents the probability that: Lily has 0 copies of the gene and does not have the trait, Harry has 1 copy of the gene and does not have the trait, and James has 2 copies of the gene and does have the trait.</p>

<p>We start with Lily (the order that we consider people does not matter, so long as we multiply the correct values together, since multiplication is commutative). Lily has 0 copies of the gene with probability <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.96</code> (this is <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS["gene"][0]</code>). Given that she has 0 copies of the gene, she doesn’t have the trait with probability <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.99</code> (this is <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS["trait"][0][False]</code>). Thus, the probability that she has 0 copies of the gene and she doesn’t have the trait is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.96 * 0.99 = 0.9504</code>.</p>

<p>Next, we consider James. James has 2 copies of the gene with probability <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.01</code> (this is <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS["gene"][2]</code>). Given that he has 2 copies of the gene, the probability that he does have the trait is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.65</code>. Thus, the probability that he has 2 copies of the gene and he does have the trait is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.01 * 0.65 = 0.0065</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we consider Harry. What’s the probability that Harry has 1 copy of the gene? There are two ways this can happen. Either he gets the gene from his mother and not his father, or he gets the gene from his father and not his mother. His mother Lily has 0 copies of the gene, so Harry will get the gene from his mother with probability <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.01</code> (this is <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS["mutation"]</code>), since the only way to get the gene from his mother is if it mutated; conversely, Harry will not get the gene from his mother with probability <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.99</code>. His father James has 2 copies of the gene, so Harry will get the gene from his father with probability <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.99</code> (this is <code class="highlighter-rouge">1 - PROBS["mutation"]</code>), but will get the gene from his mother with probability <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.01</code> (the chance of a mutation). Both of these cases can be added together to get <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.99 * 0.99 + 0.01 * 0.01 = 0.9802</code>, the probability that Harry has 1 copy of the gene.</p>

<p>Given that Harry has 1 copy of the gene, the probability that he does not have the trait is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.44</code> (this is <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROBS["trait"][1][False]</code>). So the probability that Harry has 1 copy of the gene and does not have the trait is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.9802 * 0.44 = 0.431288</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore, the entire joint probability is just the result of multiplying all of these values for each of the three people: <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.9504 * 0.0065 * 0.431288 = 0.0026643247488</code>.</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li data-marker="*"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-circle"></i></span>Recall that to compute a joint probability of multiple events, you can do so by multiplying those probabilities together. But remember that for any child, the probability of them having a certain number of genes is conditional on what genes their parents have.</li>
